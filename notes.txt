My square class I tested it by trying to instantiate a rectangle, and negative h or negative w
Then the same for the set_sides method

yup
so imagine doing that in code automatically
each test is a test case
and it passes or fails

so you might test negative
zero
positive int
3 different tests
maybe 6 if you are asserting the height == given width and width == given width
